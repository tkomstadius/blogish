I think that there's a lot of truth to that but I also suspect that there's more to the story. I mean yes, I do get my fair share of coding done at work so I don't think that I am missing out on learning and keeping up to date.  </p>\n<p>When ever I start a new project I always end up in the same place. I overthink, get stuck on silly details, get mad over everything that I don't understand and I get stressed about not choosing the correct way to do things from the start. It's not fun to code silly things if everything just end up being a monument of my own failure. It sucks the fun out of doing it and I always abandon my old projects because they were not the foundatiuon for success.</p>\n<p>I know that this is not the most healthy way of doing things so I tend not to even try. Which is a bit sad because I do think that I find coding fun. It's just that I'm so afraid of failing to meet my own demands. To combat this I am trying to redefine what \"doing it the right way\" means for me. It should not be about perfection, it should be about having fun and just doing it. The end result doesn't really matter and I don't have to understand every single line of code used. I just need to get out of my own head.</p>\n<p>If I do get something up and running it will not be code perfection or perform flawlessly. I will probably not understand every single thing I have done and it will probably not look that awesome, but that's ok. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Doing it the right way","date":"2020-03-11"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/doing-it-correct/"}}}
