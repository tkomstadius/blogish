I really detest not being present when that specific situation, idea or joke is born. It has been this way for as long as I can remember. To combat this, I have tried to do as much as I have been capable of. Saying yes to the majority of events and happenings coming my way, attending them at all costs. Forsaking exercise, proper nutrition, and rest. The biggest problem regarding this is that I always crash at some point and I do so quite often.  

The reason that I might crash more often than people in general, is that I have something called fibromyalgia. I will let my good friend Wikipedia give a light overview of what that is.  

_“Fibromyalgia is a medical condition characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include tiredness to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems and troubles with memory. ….”_

(It goes on with a whole heap of juicy side effects, my favorite being mental fog. A brief moment in time when my whole being enters a state of “WAT”.) 

I have spent a lot of time fighting with my fibro. Thinking that I do have the energy to do all things available in the world if I just make a schedule or a list and cross things off one at a time. It doesn’t work like that. My body often wins, especially when I don’t treat it right. The thing is that I do know this. But stubborn as a mule I still get stuck in thinking that I can do one more thing or sleep the day after tomorrow.  

I’ve had a lot of crashes this year. Not mini ones but rather ones like the Montparnasse derailment. (The one where the train couldn’t stop and ran through the station wall. Wikipedia can tell you about this one as well.) This is not the first year that this has happened, but it is the first year where I finally hit the brakes. I learned that it actually matters. Not just a fleeting thought to be managed later, but rather something that craves focus.  

So why am I going on about this and what does this have to do with fear of missing out, you might think? Well, it has everything to do with that. It would be easy to rest and not push myself over the limit if I wasn’t afraid of missing out, seeming lazy or uncommitted. But this year I have learned that I need to stop letting this fear be my driving force. I need to prioritize and find balance. That must be my new motivation.  

I have wonderful colleagues, friends that have given me time and energy to help me with this endeavor. Listening to me, shielding me from yet another activity and filming happenings I cannot attend. I still fall into the FOMO trap sometimes but sharing it slowly makes things easier.
